# paleoRice

paleoRice is a tool to interactively explore the spatial and temporal distributions of rice archaeobotanical sites across Asia. The options on the sidebar allow filtering of sites by various criteria, and clicking on the sites (represented by blue dots) on the map produces pop-ups containing metadata associated with each site. Each archaeobotanical site spans hundreds of years, and the filtering by years BP considers the starting date of each site. 

The tool can also be used to rudimentarily explore the association of the emergence of rice agriculture in different regions with ancient climatic shifts as reflected in changes in global temperature. For instance, rice only begins to appear more commonly in Southeast Asia after 4000 years BP following a steep global decline in temperature between 5000 and 4000 years BP. [Gutaker et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-0659-6) provided evidence that this is explained by the southward movement of tropical japonica in response to harsher effects of cooling in the north.

The data for the rice archaeobotanical sites is from the Rice Archeaological Database reported in [Silva et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137024). The data for global temperature over the last 11,300 years is from [Marcott et al., 2013](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198.long).
